# FitPulse-Health-Anomaly-Detection-from-Fitness-Devices
FitPulse is a smart health-monitoring system designed to detect anomalies in real-time fitness data collected from wearable devices (heart rate, SpO₂, steps, sleep patterns, etc.). The project aims to identify unusual patterns that may indicate potential health issues, allowing early intervention and better personal wellness tracking.
