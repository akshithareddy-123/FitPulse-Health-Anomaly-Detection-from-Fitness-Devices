Milestone 1 – Project Idea, Requirements & Initial Setup
1. Project Title

FitPulse – Health Anomaly Detection from Fitness Devices

2. Problem Statement (Very Simple Explanation)
Fitness devices collect heart rate, steps, sleep, and SpO₂ data.
People don’t always understand when these values become abnormal.
There is a need for a system that automatically detects unusual patterns and alerts the user.

3. Aim of the Project
To detect health-related anomalies using data from fitness devices using machine learning.

4. Objectives
Understand different fitness data (heart rate, activity, sleep, etc.)
Identify which anomalies need to be detected
Study suitable ML models for anomaly detection
Create the basic architecture for the system
Prepare the GitHub repo and folder structure

5. Requirements Collected
Functional Requirements:-

Accept data from fitness devices
Preprocess and clean physiological signals
Detect anomalies in real-time or from past data
Show output/alerts to the user

Non-Functional Requirements:-
Should work fast and accurately
Should handle large amounts of data
User-friendly output

6. Work Completed in Milestone 1
Finalized the project topic
Researched existing fitness device data and anomalies
Identified algorithms like Isolation Forest, LSTM Autoencoder
Prepared initial system workflow
Created GitHub repository & initial folders

7. Output of Milestone 1
Clear understanding of the project
Well-defined problem & requirements
Basic architecture ready
Project setup completed and ready for Milestone 2 development
